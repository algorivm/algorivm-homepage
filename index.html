          Our <strong>rozii</strong> system listens to the musician and
          provides visual and

          <li>The user then and performs the musical piece.</li>

          <li>The system also provides a hands-free user interface and
            feedback,
            this is an invaluable aid for visually impaired users and creates

        <h2>Our vision</h2>
        <p>
          It is important to highlight that we are not trying to use Ai
          technology to replace the human aspect of learning or teaching an
          instrument, quite the opposite:
        </p>
        <strong>Benefits for Music Teachers</strong>
        <p>
          Algorivm will assist teachers to gain more insight into their
          students' development
          and therefore offer more informed guidance to help their students
          improve.
        </p>
        <strong>Benefits for Students</strong>
        <p>
          Music students will have a practice tool that
          provides detailed feedback on their performances when practising.
          The hands-free element of our user interface will also be a unique
          and fun way to interact with Algorivm making it a fun and enjoyable
          experience, encouraging students to practice more and with improved
          results.
